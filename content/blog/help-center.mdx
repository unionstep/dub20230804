Today, we're excited to launch the [Dub Help Center](/help) – a one-stop shop for all your Dub-related questions.

Ever since we launched Dub, we've been receiving a lot of questions from our users via channels like [Crisp](https://crisp.chat/), Email, Twitter, etc. Over time, we noticed a pattern – _many of the questions were repeated_.

So we decided to build a Help Center to help our users find answers to their questions – without having to wait for us to reply.

## What's in the Help Center?

The Help Center is a collection of articles that cover the most common questions we receive from our users. It's a living knowledge base that we'll be updating regularly.

Here are some of the popular articles on the Help Center:

We've also created categories to help you find the articles you're looking for:

## Intuitive Search Experience – at your fingertips

The Help Center features a beautiful search experience that lets you find answers to your questions in a snap.

Our new search feature is typo-tolerant and lets you search for articles based on their title and anchor headings.

The best part: **It can be accessed anywhere on Dub – even inside the [Dub dashboard](https://app.dub.sh) itself**! All you need to do is enter the magic command: `CMD+K` (or `CTRL+K` on Windows). Go ahead and give it a try!

We're also planning to add an AI assistant to help you find answers to your questions in the future:

## A better support experience for our users

This is a long-awaited feature that will help us provide better support to our users.

If you have any questions or feedback about the Help Center, feel free to [send us an email](mailto:support@dub.sh?subject=Feedback%20on%20the%20Dub%20Help%20Center) or [reach out to us on Twitter](https://twitter.com/dubdotsh).
